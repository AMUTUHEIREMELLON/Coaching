            <h1>Darwin's theory of evolution</h1>
    <p>
      Darwin proposed that species can <strong>change over time</strong>, that
      new species come from <em>pre-existing species </em>, and that all species
      share a common ancestor.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this model, each species has its own unique set of heritable (genetic)
      differences from the common ancestor, which have accumulated gradually
      over very long time periods.
    </p>

    <p>
      The theory starts with the premise that within a population, there is
      variation in traits, such as beak shape in one of the Galapagos finches
      Darwin studied.
